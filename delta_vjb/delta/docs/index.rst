Welcome to DeLTA's documentation!
=================================

DeLTA (Deep Learning for Time-lapse Analysis) is a deep learning-based image 
processing pipeline for segmenting and tracking single cells in time-lapse 
microscopy movies.

Overview
--------
DeLTA revolves around a pipeline that can process movies of rod-shaped bacteria 
growing in 2D setups 
such as agarose pads, as well as movies of E. coli cells trapped in a 
microfluidic device known as a "mother machine".
Our pipeline is centered around two U-Net neural networks that are used sequentially:

* To perform semantic binary segmentation of our cells as in the original U-Net paper.
* To track cells from one movie frame to the next, and to identify cell divisions and mother/daughter cells.

A third U-Net can be used to identify regions of interest in the image before perfoming segmentation. This is used with mother machine movies to identify single chambers, but by default only 1 ROI covering the entire field-of-view is used in the 2D version.
The U-Nets are implemented in Tensorflow 2 via the Keras API.
